# Phishing-Project 🎣📨

<h2>Description</h2>

Mastercard Cybersecurity virtual experience 
* Completed a job simulation where I served as an analyst on "Mastercard's Security Awareness Team" 👮🏾‍♂️🧑‍💻
* Helped identify and report security threats such as phishing 🥷📧
* Analyzed and identified which areas of the business needed more robust security training and implemented training courses and procedures for those teams.
I worked on a project to identify phishing emails and design security awareness training courses. Through this job simulation, I built my skills in problem-solving,
data analysis, and data presentation and practiced them in a real-world context.
